# Genetic Algorithm

My implementation of a genetic algorithm to find a secret string.  

## Usage

As done in the main.rb file, require both classes then launch the program:
```ruby
require_relative 'genetic_algo'
require_relative 'chromosome'

Genetic_algo.new('tryTofiNDTHIsreALLYlongSTring').run
```

Inspired by [Sablier's tutorial](https://tech.io/playgrounds/334/genetic-algorithms/content/algorithm).
